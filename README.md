# Vim Plugins Factory

The vimfactory.org project aims to create a platform to buid Operating System native packages for Vim plugins.

## Why ?

So why the need for yet another way to retrieve Vim plugins you might ask?
Aren't there already many Vim plugins managers out there?

Answer is yes, there are a numerous Vim plugins manager that exists out there.
To only name a few, there are [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), [Pathtogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), and [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim).

**But**, if you are on a UNIX based system, Vim plugins managers miss the point.
UNIX based systems provide already a package management system.
A plugin is simply yet another package. No need for extra tooling to retrieve them.

vimfactory.org provides a system to create native operating systems packages easily, and
all the details to submit those built packages to the UNIX based distribution of your choice.

By making Vim plugins an integral part of the system, it is easier to reach a broader crowd
of people and for them it becomes less intimitading to give Vim a try. Plugins are simply
yet another package.
